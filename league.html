                    <h2>The South Island League</h2>
                    <p>The year long South Island League is going well. In the last round Dunedin travelled to Invercargill. A good win there for Dunedin against the hapless Invercargill with the sending off of Darren Carson for talking back to the ref giving Invercargill a brief glimmer of hope almost immediately extinguished by two quick goals from Dunedin. Further north Christchurch were far too strong for Nelson and romped home 7 - 1. It was much more finely balanced for us against Timaru and I was seriously worried for a while. But then an inspired individual goal by Sam broke the spirit of Timaru and they never really threatened for the rest of the game.
